# Vibrant

This is a fork of the original [RobCherry/vibrant](https://github.com/RobCherry/vibrant) package. It has two meaningful changes:

1. The `filter.isAllowed` interface method has been renamed as `filter.IsAllowed` so it is exposed as a public method. This change has been submitted as a [pull request](https://github.com/RobCherry/vibrant/pull/4).

2. The `sfomuseum` branch of this package has changed the default import path to be `github.com/sfomuseum/vibrant` mostly so that it's easier to import until (if) the PR for (1) is accepted.
